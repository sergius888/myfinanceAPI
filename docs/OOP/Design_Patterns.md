Design patterns are solutions to some software problems.

2 main advantages:
    -> best practices: learning these patterns helps devs to code easier and faster and apply the right solutions
	-> common platform for developers: provide a standard language to discuss or recognize in a codebase

3 Types of Design Patterns:
    -> creational: provide a way to create objecs, hide the creation logic if it is too complex making the code more flexible
	-> structural: creating class structures
	-> behavioural: communication between objects
