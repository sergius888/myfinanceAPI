CLI = Command Line Interface

CLI is a method to interact with the system using only text. It is usually used in a terminal. It is a very direct way, as we can call diffrent system functions without going through other applications. The learning curve can be greater than a GUI, but usually it is faster once you know your way around it.

Any app can have a CLI, just as it can have an API or GUI. We can create our own CLI over an app and the user can interact via a terminal with our app. We can ask the user values using the function `input` or we can read from command line `sys.argv` and take the user's input this way.

Another way to do it is using the library `click`. https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/ This is recommended if we want to do a more complex CLI
