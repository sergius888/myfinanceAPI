-> Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Most used system for version control is `git`

`git clone` -> clone a remote git repo

`git init` -> create a new git repo

`git branch` -> check on which branch you are

`git pull` -> take latest changes from remote repo

`git commit -m "<message>"` -> put your changes in a commit which will remain in the branch logs

`git push` -> send your commits to the remote repo

`git checkout -b <branch_name>` -> create a new branch
