1. Let's start the app from the folder project_1, uvicorn my_finance.index:app ...
   This means we need to change the imports, need to add `my_finance.` before the file in our own project
2. Stock Repo add should raise a custom exception if it cannot add a stock (CannotAddStock)
   The exception should be handled by fastapi, return a nice error message to the user
   Update the test to check for the custom exception
3. The persistance implementations should raise exceptions if it cannot add them + make test for this
4. Make test for stock repo get
5. Make test for stock repo delete
